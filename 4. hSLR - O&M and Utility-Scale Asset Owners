SolarCoin – Blockchain Incentives for Utility Scale and C&I Photovoltaic System Asset Owners and Operators – Beyond the Residential Network Effect

I. Overview

Utility-scale solar energy is now the lowest cost form of new energy generation in human history. The solar industry is growing exponentially, driven by declining costs of installation, recent favorable legislation in several countries, increased demand for carbon-free electricity, and public/private investment in renewable energy. 

With the utility scale solar energy industry, solar operations and maintenance (“O&M”) is the greatest ongoing financial cost for solar photovoltaic (“PV”) system owners. Solar PV systems are considered as low-risk, stable investments, and as such, are expected to consistently generate electricity 365 days of the year for 20-25 years without deviation. This expectation requires a tremendous amount of work, including boots-on-the-ground emergency dispatch and maintenance, vegetation management, asset management, and 24/7 remote control and alarm monitoring.

Solar PV system O&M Opex Costs are substantial and can range between $50,000 USD or more annually for the typical utility scale solar project, depending on climate, system engineering, and logistics. In addition to standard, contracted ongoing maintenance, solar PV systems encounter equipment faults, supply chain constraints, manufacturers going out of business, grid reliability and stability issues, and natural disasters like hurricanes, fires, and hail. These risks are managed by solar PV system asset owners and solar financiers through insurance, yearly budgets, and strategic O&M. 

II.  SolarCoin Overview and Blockchain Incentives 

SolarCoin (“SLR”) is a digital token that rewards solar PV asset owners for installed-solar PV capacity. The SolarCoin Foundation (“SCF”) rewards 1 SLR token for each 1 MWh produced solar energy. Built on Proof-of-Validation software, SolarCoin operates on one of the most carbon-free blockchains in the world called energy web; however, this ecosystem has very low adoption outside of Europe – and the core team has struggled to grow the community in part due to lack of access and information about the project – as well as the European centric team.   

The SolarCoin project founders (residing in Europe and Asia) are for the most part inactive, and while the ecosystem and overall ethos behind the project is loved and appreciated by many solar enthusiasts and early web3 adopters (such as the founding team of Metaverse Solar), it has very low utilization. Therefore, by expanding the SLR token utility beyond simply assuming a “network effect” by more people installing solar PV systems on their homes, there exists a substantial opportunity that considers the rise of metaverse ecosystems, and some of the inequities facing those that appreciate solar energy.  

Such inequities include a rise in part-time/gig employment and access to financing by younger generations, as well as a trend toward lower home ownership, increased career mobility and an interest by younger generations in alternative assets.  In addition, the Metaverse Solar ecosystem as contemplated with hSLR also provides greater transparency and access to solar industry professionals, as well as broader access to financing and insurance based on more specific underwriting – and alternative credit access beyond a FICO score, by way of example.  

With respect to the utility scale solar PV system sector, the hSLR token could asset with cost offsetting, transparent transactions, and cause solar PV O&M “gamification” – thus engaging solar PV system O&M technicians to perform better work and be more transparent to the customers.  

The original SLR ecosystem relies heavily on what is referred to as SolarCoin “Affiliates”. Such Affiliates refer prospective SLR customers to the SolarCoin Foundation, and have the option of taking kwh reading from the customers’ inverters (a primary equipment component in solar PV systems). SCF also provides Affiliates with the option to file a claim from SLR on behalf of the customers without the claims being issued on-chain and charges up to five percent (5%) for this service, with such commission being deducted from the customer’s SLR allocation. However, this program is hard to access, and the process for enrolling is unclear to most.     

By contrast, the Hedera Hashgraph SolarCoin version as proposed by Metaverse Solar has the opportunity to create several immediate impacts, such as: 

A. Solar PV System Repowering / Insurance Funds

Solar PV system “repowering” as it is called in the solar industry is the process of removing inefficient or otherwise obsolete solar PV system equipment and then replacing it with new or more technologically advanced equipment in its place. 

According to a report conducted by the solar industry research firm called kWh Analytics titled the “Solar Risk Report”; forty percent (40%) of the companies that manufacture the major solar PV equipment called an inverter that are installed at solar facilities built in 2018 are no longer in business (or operational).  

This lack of manufacturer support and the loss of knowledge around the equipment component (since such information is no longer readily accessible) can cause a decrease in solar PV system availability by ten percent (10%) to twenty-five percent (25%) year over year.  Similarly impactful extreme weather events, despite being a force majeure event under many contracts, can damage solar PV systems extensively – sometimes causing catastrophic fires or blowing modules off of racking (the portion of the PV system upon which the modules are bolted), all impacting the cash flow projects initially modeled for the solar PV system.  

hSLR can potentially provide solar PV system owners reserve funding for repowering underperforming solar PV systems, restoring such facilities post-extreme weather damage (as noted above), and providing an economic buffer for resolving unexpected, non-warranty covered PV systems issues such as abandoned inverters. hSLR can also be used to supplement revenue losses due to off-line or unavailable components or be used for general infrastructure improvements to drive increased up-time and performance. 

B. Offsetting Solar PV System O&M Ongoing Costs (Reducing Opex)

As touched on briefly above, solar PV system O&M is the largest fixed operating expense for PV asset owners once a solar PV system is fully constructed and operational – which means it sells solar power to the owner or to the power grid through a power purchase agreement. Such asset owners are often financial in nature, for instance, pension funds and infrastructure funds are common owners of such assets, and are often surprised when in-the-field issues cause missed revenue assumptions. For example, a 100 MW solar asset O&M costs for preventive and corrective maintenance, landscaping, monitoring and asset management range anywhere from $500,000 to $900,000 per year. 

The same 100 MW solar array generating energy is estimated to produce between 220,000 to 300,000 MWh of electricity. Below is the value in hSLR and USD at various pro-forma thresholds:

hSLR @ $0.005 = ~$1,300
hSLR @ $0.01 = ~$2,600
hSLR @ $0.25 = ~$65,000
hSLR @ $1.00 = ~$260,000
hSLR @ $5.00 = ~$1,300,000

Solar PV asset owners could allocate hSLR towards O&M budgets, thus allowing for higher individual and portfolio-level return on investment, and more funds to allocate to new projects, thus having a direct net impact on the overall deployment of solar PV assets. SolarCoin can also be used to purchase additional spare parts for reserve inventory, pay for solar PV system  optimization/ and performance engineering, as well pay a premium for safe, high-quality workmanship from KYCed teams within the Metaverse Solar ecosystem. 

C “Gamify” Solar PV System O&M

“Gamification” is the application of game design elements in non-gaming contexts. It commonly uses these elements to improve involvement (leading to achievement of objectives) of users and can be used as a proven tool capable of increasing efficiency within an interactive environment. 

Within the solar PV system O&M ecosystem, there are many “players” working to ensure solar PV systems are fully operational and providing solar power to the power grid or the owner; these include asset owners, technicians, remote operators, subcontractors, engineers, and asset management teams, to name a few.  Several examples of how the new SolarCoin ecosystem can help facilitate gamification within this ecosystem are described below. 

1.  Education / Training: hSLR can incentivize industry professionals to receive additional training or provide blockchain-based certificates. 
2.  Inspiration / Design: hSLR can be used to encourage new ideas through open-source competition or engineering challenges.
3.  Crowdsourcing: hSLR can promote collaborative development activities including: a) crowd processing –  the participation in collaborative processes aimed at solving a process / problem; b) crowd rating: collaborative construction of service and solar asset ratings; and c) crowd creating: collaborative construction of contents and software. Crowdsourcing can be incentivized by stimulating and quantifying the effort of contributors.
4.  Work and Productivity: solar PV system O&M providers can receive incentives when assets are producing and retaining high availability. Service records can be stored and available through the public ledger.
5.  Power plant health: health, environmental, and safety records can be tracked and best performers publicly acknowledged. 
6.  Crowdfunding: SolarCoin gamification techniques can be implemented to promote additional investments and lead investors to build differentiated portfolios within the solar ecosystem. 



III. Challenges

The primary challenge to the existing SolarCoin ecosystem is adoption.  While solar PV asset owners anywhere in the world, large or small, are able to register their assets through the SolarCoin Foundation – few asset owners take this step. As of June 2023, there are currently very little assets registered, and a small fraction of minted SLR tokens available for trade and use. Increasing awareness, community, access and participation within the SolarCoin economy will be critical to this project’s success. 

IV. Solution

Metaverse Solar bridges the gap between virtual and real-world solar assets. The Metaverse Solar team will catalyze the SolarCoin economy by building a one-way bridge from Energy Web Chain (where SLR currently sits) to Hedera Hasgraph using HTS to mint wrapped SLR = hSLR. 

On the residential side, Metaverse Solar will then use hSLR as its in-game currency and will create MVSLR as 1x hSLR = 1000x MVSLR similar to Bitcoin and "Satoshi" currency denominations. Using our deep industry contacts, government and finance relationships and broad, practical approach to the business - we intend to drive widespread user awareness, interest, and enthusiasm around solar energy through the world's first solar gaming studio powered by Hedera Hashgraph and the SolarCoin ecosystem. In turn, this will drive both network effect and value for hSLR in-game, and support gamification of real-world solar operations and asset management.
