# MVSLR
Metaverse Solar "Beyond Blockchain" Hackathon submission


Project Name: Metaverse Solar 

Project Summary: Metavese Solar (MVSLR) is the world's first solar gaming studio and is built on Hedera Hashgraph and SolarCoin (SLR) Protocol technology. Metaverse Solar is a cutting edge, “game-as-a-service” that leverages Virtual Solar Facilities (VSF) and a network of renewable energy enthusiasts, home renovation experts, solar installers, equipment providers, maintenance companies and even financing companies can interact with each other - and provide valuable services through an interactive social network. The native-token is wrapped SolarCoin, or hSLR, that is created through a one-way bridge from Ethereum-based Energy Web Chain (SLR's native network) to Hedera using HTS. Metaverse Solar users will be able to earn hSLR in-game as MVSLR, where 1x hSLR = 1,000x MVSLR; similar to the Bitcoin and smaller-denomination Satoshi relationship. 

For reference, the SolarCoin Foundation has minted 98 Billion SolarCoins on EWC - this amount reflects ~40 years of estimated solar energy production from 2010 to 2050.

The Metaverse Solar hSLR bridge Smart Contract only has 15 Billion hSLR available for minting - this amount reflects 5 years of estimated solar energy production from 2023 - 2028. 

Problems:

1. The gaming industry lacks games focused on, or otherwise incorporating, renewable energy.
2. Accessing reliable solar services & financing is difficult + inconvenient.
3. Installers and maintenance firms rely heavily on door knocking and social media advertising.
4. There are limited opportunities for the younger generation to participate in ESG initiatives.
5. Disinformation about solar energy is still prevalent.
6. Despite once being a top-10 token, SolarCoin has not had wide user-adoption
